# **Analysing crowdfunding data to determine factors that could make a campaign successful**
## **Why this project:**
* On this project, I helped an up-and-coming playwright who wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play which she estimated a budget of over $10k. I will be identifying trends that lead campaigns to be successful, to be canceled or failed. To accomplish this, I sorted, organized, and analyzed crowdfunding data in excel, using pivot tables, pivot graphs, conditional formatting, and doing statistic analysis. Finally, the analysis is focused on Theaters and Plays campaigns.
